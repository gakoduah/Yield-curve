# Advanced Yield Curve Analysis with PCA and Dynamic Factor Modeling

## Objective
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decompose yield curve movements into interpretable factors (level, slope, curvature) for risk management and scenario analysis in quantitative finance.

## Key Techniques
- Nelson-Siegel model for synthetic yield curve generation with macroeconomic shocks
- PCA decomposition of covariance matrix (99% variance captured by 3 factors)
- Dynamic factor modeling with animated decomposition
- Interactive 3D visualization of factor space

  ## How to Use
  - Run Jupyter notebook sequentially
  - Interact with Plotly charts (slider for time evolution)
  - View animations in notebook or save as GIF/MP4
 
  ## Conclusion
  The analysis successfully:
 - Identified three interpretable factors driving yield curve changes
 - Achieved dimensionality reduction (10 maturities to 3 factors)
 - Demonstrated shock propagation through factor loadings
 - Provided tools for risk factor monitoring and scenario analysis

### Perfect for:

- Fixed income risk management
- Macroeconomic research
- Portfolio stress testing
